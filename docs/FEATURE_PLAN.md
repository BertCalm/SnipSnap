# The six features, planned to done

The ROI-ranked feature list, mapped onto concrete work. This is the
product-facing cut of the plan; [`APP_PLAN.md`](APP_PLAN.md) stays the
authoritative milestone view of the app build — work items below reference
its milestones rather than restating them.

**Owners.** `APP` = the desktop session building `:app` (Android SDK,
Compose, services). `CORE` = the cloud session (pure Kotlin/JVM modules —
everything testable without a device). `USER` = hardware checks on the
Live III. Sizes: S ≈ under a day, M ≈ 1–3 days, L ≈ a week-plus.

**The shape of the whole plan in one sentence:** every feature's backend is
done; the CORE column below is a short list of small items that shrink the
APP column further, the APP column is M0–M5 wearing feature names, and the
USER column is one card session.

---

## F1 — The capture-to-export shell (the MVP loop)

**Done:** the entire logic layer. `:shell` holds the trim transport
(`TapeDeckModel` + `PeaksPyramid`), grid state (`KitBuilderModel`), export
flow (`ExportWizardModel` over the shared `Exporters`), pad voices
(`VoiceAllocator`), scheme/type/layout/motion tables, and the personality
gates — all tested. Capture buffer, cleanup DSP, and every writer were
already done and hardware-verified for drums.

**Remaining (all APP; = APP_PLAN M0–M5):**

| # | Work | Size | Exit test |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1.1 | M0 walking skeleton — theme, nav, `KitStore` shelf | M | browse kits, tap pads, hear WAVs, flip schemes |
| F1.2 | M1 capture — service, MediaProjection, bubble, mic, silence detection, QS tile | L | snip YouTube from inside YouTube; snip the room; share a video in |
| F1.3 | M2 tape deck — bind Compose to `TapeDeckModel`/`PeaksPyramid` | M | a YouTube snip becomes a clean one-shot, cut on the hit |
| F1.4 | M4 play mode — Oboe, bind `VoiceAllocator` | M | finger drumming feels tight on a mid-range phone |
| F1.5 | M5 export wizard — SAF, bind `ExportWizardModel` | M | the card writes; the Live III plays it |

M3 is feature F2 below. Risks and their standing: APP_PLAN's table.

## F2 — One-tap Instant Kit

**Done:** the full pipeline (`Transients` → `Chopper` → `Classifier` →
`AutoPlace` → `KitAssembler`), the review screen's whole state machine
(`ChopReviewModel`: tap-to-cycle chips, NOT SURE, placement preview,
SEND TO GRID), and the first real-audio proof (the CLI chopped the factory
groove: kick→A01, hats choking, 92 BPM detected).

| # | Work | Owner | Size | Exit test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F2.1 | CHOP screen — bind Compose to `ChopReviewModel`, defrag-grid progress gag (= APP_PLAN M3) | APP | M | one captured bar → playable, sensibly-laid-out kit in under a minute |
| F2.2 | The one tap — INSTANT KIT action on a fresh capture: chop with defaults straight into review | APP | S | capture 8 s of a break, tap once, play the kit |
| F2.3 | Calibration harness — a labeled-corpus test: WAVs + expected classes under `reference/calibration/`, a report of confusion + per-threshold sensitivity; tune `Classifier` against it | CORE | S | thresholds justified by real captures, not synthetic renders |
| F2.4 | Calibration corpus — a dozen real captured hits (phone captures, not renders), labeled by ear | USER | S | F2.3 has something true to chew on |

`snipsnap classify` is the collection tool for F2.4 — it prints the
features next to every verdict.

## F3 — Share-sheet import

**Done:** the file half. `WavReader` (any PCM/float rate/depth) + the sinc
`Resampler` are the working import path — the CLI is this feature running
on desktop today. The risk table's opt-out mitigation depends on this.

| # | Work | Owner | Size | Exit test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F3.1 | Intent filters + receive activity → trim screen | APP | S | shared audio file lands in the tape deck |
| F3.2 | Video demux — `MediaExtractor`/Media3 → float PCM → `Snip` → `Resampler` | APP | M | shared MP4's audio lands in the tape deck |
| F3.3 | Demux conformance fixtures — tiny known-content WAV fixtures + a contract test the app's decode output must pass (rate, channels, sample accuracy) | CORE | S | app-side decode verified against ground truth without an SDK |
| F3.4 | Onboarding copy for opt-out apps (silence detection → screen-recorder path) — copy exists in `Copy`; wire it | APP | S | blocked capture shows the honest fallback, in voice |

## F4 — Synth starter kits

**Done:** the most finished feature. Seven engines + FX, `SynthKits` /
`ThumpKits` / `Shuffle` are **main-source** (the app can call them
directly), recipes rebuild kits bit-for-bit from `kit.json`, SCRAMBLE is
bounded macro rolls, and two generated kits are hardware-verified.

| # | Work | Owner | Size | Exit test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F4.1 | Starter-kit registry — `StarterKits` in `:shell`: name → builder → blurb → seed policy, wrapping the main-source builders so the FRESH TAPE menu is data-driven | CORE | S | registry renders every kit through assemble→preflight in a test |
| F4.2 | NEW KIT menu — pick a starter, reroll seed, land on the grid (needs M0 only) | APP | S | first-run user has a playable kit in 30 s, empty grid never shows |
| F4.3 | SYNTH screen — macro panels over `Patches`, SCRAMBLE, RENDER TO PAD (= the M5 synth half) | APP | M | prototype's Thump Lab behaviour, on device |

Also yields rights-clean Play Store demo content for free.

## F5 — In-key capture

**Done:** `Pitch`/`Scales`/`Tuner`/`InKey` — detection, nearest-in-key
retune via the MPC's own tune fields, refusal to touch unpitched material.
Shipping today as the CLI's `--key`.

| # | Work | Owner | Size | Exit test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F5.1 | Promote the key grammar — `KeySpec` (Am / F#m / "Eb major" / Dminpent parsing) moved from `:cli` into `:audio`, beside `Scales` where it belongs; CLI delegates | CORE | S | one parser, two consumers, same tests |
| F5.2 | Kit key field — optional `key` on `Kit`/`kit.json` so the choice persists with the folder | CORE | S | round-trips through `KitStore`; absent = no key, old kits unaffected |
| F5.3 | Key picker + pad tune readout — kit-level key in the kit screen; IN KEY as a kit action; optional retune-on-assign for TONAL pads | APP | S | set Am, drop a captured bass note, it lands in key; the kick is untouched |

## F6 — One-file kit sharing (.xpn)

**Done:** `XpnPackager` writes the real-archive layout deterministically;
`xpn` is in the `Exporters` fan-out; `SnipSnap_Factory.xpn` is built and
waiting.

| # | Work | Owner | Size | Exit test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F6.1 | Hardware import check — does the Live III's expansion import accept `SnipSnap_Factory.xpn`? (Part 2 queue, item 4) | USER | S | yes/no + exact error text if no |
| F6.2 | `XpnImporter` — read an `.xpn` back into a kit folder (unzip, parse the program, resolve bare sample names); free CLI `import` command; the receive half of sharing | CORE | S | pack → import → re-export round-trips; a foreign commercial `.xpn` imports |
| F6.3 | Share/receive flow — ACTION_SEND a kit as `.xpn`; intent-filter receives one → `XpnImporter` → the shelf | APP | S | kit → messenger → friend's phone → their shelf → their MPC |

F6.2 doesn't wait on F6.1: importing serves the app-to-app share loop even
if the hardware importer says no (folders remain the hardware path).

## Sequence

```
CORE (now, any order — none block APP, each shrinks it):
  F6.2 XpnImporter → F5.1 KeySpec promotion → F5.2 Kit.key →
  F4.1 StarterKits registry → F3.3 demux fixtures → F2.3 calibration harness
  (F2.3 idles until F2.4's corpus exists — build the harness, wait for WAVs)

APP (in milestone order; feature items slot in where their parent lands):
  M0 (F1.1) → +F4.2 new-kit menu
  M1 (F1.2) → +F3.1/F3.2/F3.4 import
  M2 (F1.3)
  M3 (F2.1) → +F2.2 one-tap · +F5.3 key picker
  M4 (F1.4)
  M5 (F1.5 + F4.3) → +F6.3 share flow

USER (one card session, value order — ideally before M5):
  Session .xpj → native keys + instruments → MPC 2 keys →
  F6.1 .xpn import + expansion tile → velocity/bank B →
  the Live III drum-program save (reference/golden/liveiii-36/)
  … and F2.4's dozen labeled captures whenever the phone can capture
```

Dependency truths: nothing in the CORE column blocks anything; M0 gates
every APP feature item; F6.1 gates only the *claim* that `.xpn` loads on
hardware, not the share loop; the product ships when M5's exit test passes.
