 * The rack's named characters, available one pad at a time — the remix
 * bank's five (reversed, crushed, slapback, washed, punched) and the
 * ones that arrived after the bank's table was pinned ([EXTRA]).
 * [amount] scales the chain's macros linearly (1 = the character's own
 * settings, lower = subtler); structure switches like reverse stay
 * switched.
 *
 * Every application returns the fx-only recipe that made it, so a treated
 * pad remains re-treatable and undoable like everything else in a kit.
